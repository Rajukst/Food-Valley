                <p class="para">Maque choux is a Creole dish originating from Louisiana. It is typically prepared with a
                    combination of corn, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions, and some recipes also call for the addition
                    of celery and garlic. The ingredients are braised until tender, and maque choux is then served as a
                    side dish.

                    times. These coiled tips of young ostrich ferns usually grow near rivers in lakes in Maine, and
                    they're harvested during April, May, and June. The flavor of fiddleheads is often described as a
                    combination of asparagus, mushrooms, and spinach.</p>
